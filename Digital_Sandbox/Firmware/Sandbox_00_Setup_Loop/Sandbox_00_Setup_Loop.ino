// Sandbox 00: Setup and Loop

/* This example serves as an introduction to the Digital Sandbox, Arduino code,
   and physical computing.
   
   This experiment introduces setup(), loop(), and some basic syntax.
   
   Oh, by the way, this is a comment (as is the very top line of this sketch).
   Any text that lives between a SLASH-ASTERISK and a ASTERISK-SLASH is a 
   multi-line comment. Comments are useful bits of text that are completely 
   ignored by the Arduino. They help you, or others, read your code, but they 
   have no effect on what the code does. There are no syntax rules or even 
   spell-cheking in comments.
   
   This is a multi-line comment -- anything within the slashes and asterisks
   will be commented out.
*/

// And this is a single-line comment. Any line preceded with TWO FORWARD SLASHES
// is commented out.
   
   
/* void setup() is required in every Arduino sketch. Code within the { and } of
   setup runs ONCE and ONLY ONCE at the very beginning of your program. This
   function is useful for one-time "setup" lines of code that prepare your 
   Arduino to run the rest of its program.
*/
void setup()	// Don't forget the ( and ) directly after the word setup.
{	// As you'll discover throughout your programming experience every {...
	
	
	// (code would go here, if we were so inclined.)
	
	
}	// ...requires a mating }.


/* void loop() is also REQUIRED in every program. It contains the bulk of your 
   Arduino program.
   
*/
void loop()	// Don't forget the parenthesis -- and the "void" before.
{
	// 1: The loop would start here...
	// 2: Then run this line of code...
	// 3: Then this one...
	// ...
	// ...
	// End of loop: Then this one, then jump back up to the first line of loop.
