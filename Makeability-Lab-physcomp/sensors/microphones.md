To learn about using microphones with the Arduino, we suggest beginning with [this guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-microphone-amplifier-breakout/overview) by Adafruit. There are many others online.

You may also want to try our [example source code](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/arduino/tree/master/Sensors/Microphone) in our Arduino github repo.
