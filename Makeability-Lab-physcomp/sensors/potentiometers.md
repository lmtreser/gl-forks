Please see our [Potentiometers lesson](../arduino/potentiometers.md) as part of our [Intro to Input](../arduino/intro-input.md) series.

Are Potentiometers even sensors? Well, they are a type of variable resistor and often used to sense human input, so I would say yes! :)

A [video](https://youtu.be/5qxQheanSkQ) demonstration of a [trimpot](https://www.adafruit.com/product/356) hooked up to analog input A0 on the Arduino and its value graphed on an OLED display in real-time. The code is available [here](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/arduino/blob/master/OLED/AnalogGraph/AnalogGraph.ino).
