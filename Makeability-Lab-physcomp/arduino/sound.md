Notes:
- Because sound is so vast, I wonder if it should have it's own H1? Probably... Maybe similar to motors?
- Vi Hart's "What's up with noises: The science and mathematics of sound, frequency, and pitch" is a lovely [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_0DXxNeaQ0) and recommended by Allen Downey in his SciPy2015 DSP talk ([link](https://youtu.be/0ALKGR0I5MA?t=96))
