If you're not familiar with Python—or even if you are—it's a good idea to start with this (rapid) [introduction to Python](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals/blob/master/Tutorials/IntroToPython.ipynb). It will also give you a feel for Jupyter Notebook. To gain the most value from these example Notebooks, you should modify and run the cells yourself (and add your own cells).

You can view the Notebook in [html here](IntroToPython.html) but we also **strongly** recommend working with our Notebooks locally by performing a git clone on `https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals.git` and running Jupyter Notebook on your system (see [installation notes](jupyter-notebook.md)). 

Additionally, for quick interactive access to editable versions, you can use:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/makeabilitylab/signals/master?filepath=Tutorials%2FIntroToPython.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/makeabilitylab/signals/blob/master/Tutorials/IntroToPython.ipynb).

## Next Lesson

In the [next lesson](numpy.md), you will learn about and use the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) scientific computing library for Python. NumPy provides a suite of methods to help process and analyze time-series data.
