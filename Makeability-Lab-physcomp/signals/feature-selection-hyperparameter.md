This [Notebook](FeatureSelectionAndHyperparameterTuning/index.html) introduces how to use [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for automatic feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.

You can view the Notebook in [html here](FeatureSelectionAndHyperparameterTuning/index.html) but we also **strongly** recommend working with our Notebooks locally by performing a git clone on `https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals.git` and running the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals/blob/master/Projects/GestureRecognizer/Feature%20Selection%20and%20Hyperparameter%20Tuning.ipynb) on your system (see [installation notes](jupyter-notebook.md)).
