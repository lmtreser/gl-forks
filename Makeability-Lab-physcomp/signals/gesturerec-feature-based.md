This [Notebook](gesturerec/featurebased/index.html) introduces a feature-based (or model-based) supervised learning approach to gesture recognition and provides the scaffolding for the A4 assignment.

You can view the Notebook in [html here](gesturerec/featurebased/index.html) but we also **strongly** recommend working with our Notebooks locally by performing a git clone on `https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals.git` and running the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals/blob/master/Projects/GestureRecognizer/GestureRecognizer-FeatureBased.ipynb) on your system (see [installation notes](jupyter-notebook.md)).

## Next Lesson

In the [next lesson](feature-selection-hyperparameter.md), you'll learn how to use [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for automatic feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.
