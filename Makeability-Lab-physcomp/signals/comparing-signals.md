This [Notebook](ComparingSignals/index.html) introduces techniques to compare signals in the time domain, including Euclidean distance, cross-correlation, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).

You can view the Notebook in [html here](ComparingSignals/index.html) but we also **strongly** recommend working with our Notebooks locally by performing a git clone on `https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals.git` and running the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals/blob/master/Tutorials/Signals%20-%20Comparing%20Signals.ipynb) on your system (see [installation notes](jupyter-notebook.md)).

## Next Lesson

In the [next lesson](frequency-analysis.md), you'll learn about frequency analysis, including Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) and the intuition for how they work, Fast Fourier Transforms and spectral frequency plots, and Short-time Fourier Transforms (STFTs) and spectrograms.
