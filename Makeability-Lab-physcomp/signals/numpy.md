We'll be using the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) library and [NumPy arrays](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.html) as one of our primary data structures. Use [this notebook](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals/blob/master/Tutorials/IntroToNumPy.ipynb) to build up some initial familiarity. You need not become an expert here but it's useful to understand what `np.array`'s are and how they're used and manipulated.

You can view the Notebook in [html here](IntroToNumPy.html) but we also **strongly** recommend working with our Notebooks locally by performing a git clone on `https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals.git` and running Jupyter Notebook on your system (see [installation notes](jupyter-notebook.md)).

Additionally, for quick interactive access to editable versions, you can use:
[![Open in Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/makeabilitylab/signals/master?filepath=Tutorials%2FIntroToNumPy.ipynb) [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/makeabilitylab/signals/blob/master/Tutorials/IntroToNumPy.ipynb)

## Next Lesson

In the [next lesson](matplotlib.md), you will learn about and use the [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) visualization library for Python. Matplotlib will help us visualize and analyze our data.
