This [Notebook](QuantizationAndSampling/index.html) introduces the two primary factors in digitizing an analog signal: **quantization** and **sampling**. Describes and shows the effect of different quantization levels and sampling rates on real signals (audio data) and introduces the Nyquist sampling theorem, aliasing, and some frequency plots.

You can view the Notebook in [html here](QuantizationAndSampling/index.html) but we also **strongly** recommend working with our Notebooks locally by performing a git clone on `https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals.git` and running the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/signals/blob/master/Tutorials/Signals%20-%20Quantization%20and%20Sampling.ipynb) on your system (see [installation notes](jupyter-notebook.md)).

## Next Lesson

In the [next lesson](comparing-signals.md), you'll learn techniques to compare signals in the time domain, including Euclidean distance, cross-correlation, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).
