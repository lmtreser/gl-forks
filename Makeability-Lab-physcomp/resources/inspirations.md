## Project Hubs
Need something to inspire you? Check out these project pages.

- [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/). Step-by-step maker tutorials ranging from woodworking to fabric craft to electronics. I will ocassionally invite students to post Instructables of their work in my courses to more broadly share their creativity and knowledge (e.g., [Fall 2012](https://www.instructables.com/id/CMSC838f-Fall-2012-Tangible-Interactive-Computing-/), [Spring 2014](https://www.instructables.com/id/CMSC838f-Spring-2014-Tangible-Interactive-Computin/), [Spring 2015](https://www.instructables.com/id/CMSC838f-Spring-2015-Tangible-Interactive-Computin/))

- [Arduino Project Hub](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub). Arduino's official project hub for makers to post their projects and tutorials.

- [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/). Hackaday shares daily updates about IoT, robotics, and other interactive electronics projects. [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/) is their version of the Arduino Project Hub.
