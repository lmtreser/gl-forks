There are a wide range of physical computing related courses at UW across many departments from Art to Engineering. Here's a sample (ordered alphabetically by course number).

### Undergrad
Many of the 400 level courses are open to both ugrads and grads. In DXARTS, for example, the split is roughly 60% ugrad and 40% grad.
