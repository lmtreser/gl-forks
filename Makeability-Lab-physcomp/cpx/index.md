Welcome! These tutorials are designed to be completed **in order**.

## [Lesson 1: Introduction to the CPX and MakeCode](cpx.md)

In [this lesson](cpx.md), you'll learn about the Circuit Playground Express (CPX), how it differs from and relates to the Arduino platform, and how to program the board.

## [Lesson 2: Programming the CPX with MakeCode](makecode.md)

In [this lesson](makecode.md), we will make our first MakeCode+CPX programâ€”called Blinky. As we build, we will learn about the MakeCode programming environment, the simulator, and how to load our program on to the CPX.
