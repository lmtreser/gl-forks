Lesson 1: Our first MakeCode program
In this lesson, we will learn about programming the CPX with MakeCode, including:

- MakeCode interface overview
    - https://makecode.adafruit.com/courses/maker/general/coding/environment
    - https://makecode.adafruit.com/courses/maker/general/load-manage-programs
- Building our first program: blinky
- Using the simulator
- Saving programs and sharing programs
- Playing with Neopixels
- Building first program with startup sound and then forever loop

- Maybe have full video recording of myself doing this and post to YouTube?

Lesson 2: More lights and console logging
- CrossFade example with console logging: https://makecode.com/_WsCHuiTjeUoD
- Introduce switch to help with debugging or not



Neopixel
- Each Neopixel is made up of tiny RGB LEDs: https://youtu.be/Bo0cM2qmuAE?t=137
- We can use the MakeCode direct color to select specific colors
- Or loop through our own colors
- Talk about Neopixel strips: https://youtu.be/Bo0cM2qmuAE?t=238 at very end

Lesson 3: Interaction, Sound, and Console Logging

- Show our paper keyboard? Similar to: https://makecode.adafruit.com/courses/maker/projects/music-maker

Lesson 3: Sensors?

- Example project: magic wand takes accel + speaker: https://makecode.adafruit.com/projects/magic-wand
- https://learn.adafruit.com/sensors-in-makecode

Lesson 4: Touch input

- https://makecode.adafruit.com/learnsystem/pins-tutorial/touch-input

Lesson 5: Keyboard and Mouse

- Show examples

- What could we use as mouse? Button presses? Need analog input. Could do potentiometer (but maybe that's Week 4?)


OTHER THINGS
- What about haptics?
