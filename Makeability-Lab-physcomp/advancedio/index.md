Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to the third module in your Physical Computing adventure: **Advanced I/O**. Do not be intimidated by the **advanced** prefix. The content here is not more complicated than the first two modules, though they do build on them:
1. [Introduction to Electronics](../electronics/index.md)
2. [Introduction to Microcontrollers Using Arduino](../arduino/index.md)

As usual, these lessons are interactiveâ€”that is, they assume that you're following along and building **with us**. They are designed to be completed **in order**. All Arduino code is open source and in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/arduino).

## Output

### [L1: OLED Displays](oled.md)
In [this lesson](oled.md), you will learn about organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, basic graphics programming, and a brief introduction to two serial communication protocols called [I<sup>2</sup>C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) (Inter-Integrated Circuit) and [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface) (Serial Peripheral Interface).

### [L2: Vibromotors](vibromotor.md)
In [this lesson](vibromotor.md), you will learn about vibration motors (vibromotors), their role in haptic technology, and how to connect them with microcontrollers.

## Input

### [L1: Smoothing Input](smoothing-input.md)

In [this lesson](smoothing-input.md), we will learn how to smooth incoming sensor data using basic digital signal processing. We'll cover a class of digital filters called smoothing algorithms (aka **signal filters**), why they're helpful, and potential tradeoffs in their implementation and use.
