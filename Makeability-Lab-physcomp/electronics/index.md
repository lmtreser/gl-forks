Welcome ðŸ‘‹ to the first "step" in your Physical Computing journey!

In this module, you will learn about the fundamentals of electricityâ€”[voltage, current, and resistance](electricity-basics.md)â€”and how these elements can be used to build circuits that turn on lights, spin motors, and do other "work." You'll also learn about an empirically derived relationship, called [Ohm's Law](ohms-law.md), that relates voltage, current, and resistance together and methods to analyze circuits using Ohm's Law. Finally, you'll learn about three common circuit elements (resistors,  LEDs, variable resistors), how they work, and how to use them in circuits.

Throughout, you'll use simulation tools like [CircuitJS](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html) and [Tinkercad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/) to design and evaluate circuits and then actually build them using physical components.

By the end of this module, you will be prepared to start [Module 2](../arduino/index.md)â€”which is our endeavor into using electronics with microcontrollers!

## [Lesson 1: Voltage, current, and resistance](electricity-basics.md)

Introduces three key electricity concepts, [current, voltage, and resistance](electricity-basics.md), which form the foundation of electronics and circuits.

## [Lesson 2: Circuit Schematics](schematics.md)

Introduces a visual language for describing circuits called [circuit schematics](schematics.md), which are used in component datasheets, CAD programs (*e.g.,* circuit simulators, PCB layout software), and circuit analyses. Also includes an activity using [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) to build your own schematics.

## [Lesson 3: Ohm's Law](ohms-law.md)

Introduces [Ohmâ€™s Law](ohms-law.md), one of the most important empirical laws in electrical circuits that describes how current, voltage, and resistance relate together. Also includes an activity to build and explore resistive circuits in [CircuitJS](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html).

## [Lesson 4: Series vs. Parallel Resistors](series-parallel.md)

Introduces [series and parallel resistor circuits](series-parallel.md), how to analyze them, and why they're important. Also includes an activity to build and explore series and parallel resistor configurations in [CircuitJS](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html).

## [Lesson 5: Resistors](resistors.md)

Building on Lessons 1 - 4, let's dive more deeply into [resistors](resistors.md) and learn about how resistors work, how they're made, how they're characterized in terms of both resistance $$R$$ and power $$P$$, and how to "read" them.

## [Lesson 6: LEDs](leds.md)

In [this lesson](leds.md), we'll introduce one of the most common electrical components in the world: [light-emitting diodes](leds.md) or [LEDs](leds.md). You'll learn about your first semiconductor device, diodes, and how they're non-ohmic and only allow current to pass in one direction. Then, we'll introduce a special kind of diode, called an LED, and show how to use them, how to select an appropriate current-limiting resistor, and why resistors are necessary. You'll also get to physically build stuff, yay!

## [Lesson 7: Breadboards](breadboards.md)

In [this lesson](breadboards.md), we'll learn about a very useful circuit prototyping tool called breadboards, which makes it easy to rapidly build circuits (and plug/unplug components and wires).

## [Lesson 8: Variable resistors](variable-resistors.md)

In [this lesson](variable-resistors.md), we'll learn about variable resistors, a certain kind of variable resistor called a potentiometer, and then we'll design, simulate, and build some LED circuits using variable resistors. At the end, you'll even make your own DIY variable resistor!

<!-- ## [Lesson 9: Using a multimeter](multimeter.md)

TODO: or could integrate this somewhere else?   -->

<!-- # TODO

<!-- ## Old lesson plan

- L1: What is electricity: current, voltage, and resistance + online simulation activities
- Circuit schematics?
- LX: Common electronic components: resistors and LEDs
- L2: Ohm's Law + example circuit equations/solving + online simulation activities
- L3: Measuring current, voltage, and resistance using multimeters
- L4: Series vs. parallel resistance

- L4: How to use a breadboard + moving your prev circuit to breadboards
- LX: What are LEDs and resistors?
- L5: Series vs. Parallel Resistance, Voltage Dividers, and Ohm's Law
- LX: Building your first circuit: lighting up an LED, swapping out different resistances (maybe paper-based version)

Should I have a small lesson on what is a resistor and what is an LED (or perhaps I fold that into Lesson 2).
